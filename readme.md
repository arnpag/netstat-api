This project is currently somewhat unguided. It may turn into a more useful api eventually, but there is probably a log of work needed before that can happen.

Currently working on doing some test driven development
Probably should start storing this on git so I don't lose it and can move it around some more

Backlog of tasks:
    * Connect to postgres database
    * Add app to docker
    * create app?


Completed:
    * Connect to h2 database
